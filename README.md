Car Showroom Management System aims to transform the traditional car dealership operations into a modern, efficient, and customer-centric business process.

# Project Overview:

•	The project aims to create a car showroom management system using Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

•	It involves designing classes, implementing inheritance, and utilizing polymorphism.

## Project Setup:

• Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code).

•	Set up the necessary project structure (directories, packages, etc.). 

## Project Structure:

•	The main classes include Showroom, Employees, and Cars, with Showroom extending attributes from both Employees and Cars.

•	Attributes for Showroom include name, address, manager's name, total number of cars, and employees.

•	Attributes for Employees include name, ID, and department.

## Functionalities:

•	The main menu allows users to add a new showroom, view showroom data, and get lists of employees and cars.

•	An Interface named Utility is created to demonstrate its use in live projects.

# Practical Application:

•	The project demonstrates the practical use of encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance.

•	It provides a foundation for building similar management systems like hospital or vaccine management systems, and can be added to personal portfolios or resumes.

## Car Showroom Management System Features:

o	The project includes features related to managing a car showroom.

o	These features might include adding new showrooms, managing employee details, and handling car inventory.

o	The system allows interaction with showrooms, employees, and cars.

## Class Hierarchy:

o	The project defines several classes, including: 

 	Showroom: Represents a car showroom.

 	Employee: Contains attributes like name, ID, and department.

 	Utility: An interface that provides utility methods (e.g., adding showrooms).

o	The relationships between these classes (inheritance, composition) are crucial for the project’s functionality.

## Takeaways:

o	By following this project, you’ll gain practical experience in OOP concepts.

o	You can apply similar principles to other management systems (e.g., hospital management, vaccine management).


## Inheritance and Polymorphism:

o	Utilize inheritance: 

  	Employee can inherit from a base class (e.g., Person).

 	Implement common methods (e.g., displayDetails) in the base class.

o	Implement polymorphism: 

   	Use method overriding to customize behavior (e.g., calculateSalary for different employee types).

## Attributes and Relationships:

o	Showroom attributes: 

 	Name

  	Address
 
  	Manager (an instance of Employee)
  
o	Employee attributes: 

  	Name
  
  	Employee ID
  
  	Department
  
## Main Menu Functionality:

o	Create a menu-driven interface for users: 

	Add a new showroom (using the addShowroom method).

	Display existing showrooms and their details.

	Add employees to showrooms.

	Retrieve employee information.

## Testing and Execution:

o	Write a Main class with a main method.

o	Instantiate objects (showrooms, employees) and test various functionalities.

o	Ensure that the project compiles and runs without errors.

## Run the Project:

o	Compile and execute the project.

o	Interact with the menu options to add showrooms, employees, and retrieve information.
